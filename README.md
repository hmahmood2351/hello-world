# Hello World: My spin on a classical entry to the developing world.

## Preface

Hey! If you're reading this, this aims to be the start of me displaying some of the stuff that I like to look into in my spare time. My interests lie in Networking/Cloud/Automation and more can be read about that on my profile page.

This repository aims to do a small dive into the world of networking and automation, and use cases for different tools. I like to look at tools such as Ansible and Nornir and think to myself: "What's the real use case here? How can I benefit and meet the demands of a business by employing said automation tool?"

The business demand (and what a great demand it is!) in this project of mine is having the proliferation of a single configuration statement within a set of networking devices in a topology. The aim rather is not to focus on the actual thing being done, as that thing can change, and can be something small or big. Rather, it's to focus on the **reason why we adopt automation tools and frameworks**. The fact that this single small configuration (that can just as easily be done by hand) can be extended to hundreds of devices with a template, and that small configuration task can change from something small to something very big, can be something that is thought about when pondering upon the use-cases for these tools. I aim to document the stages that I go throughout the process of exploring various tools to meet the business demand within this repository.

I'm still at a learning stage and exploring not only the various tools listed in this project, but also the design principles and key ideas that come to designing a solution and solving a problem (in the context of networking and automation). I'm always happy to take feedback and learn from others, so please do send me a message about anything relating to this project.

## The Business Requirement

Keeping it simple, the requirement is to configure all networking devices on the topology below (showing a LAN at a branch site) with the MOTD (message of the day) banner being set to "Hello World!".


## Logical Topology

The following topology was made using GNS3:

TBD. GNS3 Topology



## Roadmap

The old fashioned way (by hand!)


Configuration Management

Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines

Migration of services to a cloud provider (Azure based)

NetDevOps (?) principles


## The Tools

Fingers

Netmiko

Ansible

Nornir

NAPALM
